This project is to build a simple contact form using HTML and CSS. This one is my first self-developed project with minimal assistance of ChatGPT. (Please understand that I am a self-learning web dev, and it takes
a lot of time to build it on my own :) )

I will update this project as I learn more concepts in CSS, because, this is a very simple one. And I really wanted to update this into something more complex. So, whatever I edit in this thing, I'll either mention
them in this README file, or I'll do something to update them.
